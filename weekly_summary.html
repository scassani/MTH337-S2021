<h2>Week 7<a class="headerlink" href="#week-7" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Where can I find the recorded lecture videos?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>this question was asked in week 1. See the answer below (Hint: search for the word Panopto</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How does the bonus work increase our project grade, i.e. how do you quantify it?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A Bonus moves you up one letter grade : from C to C+ for example</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will we have more bonus questions in future projects?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>maybe</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can you explain more about boolean, array? Can we have more example in the class material?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>yes</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Since we have 2 weeks to work on every project, and there will be a lot of people going to office hours on the second week. It is possible to move office hours for the first week to the second week?  so students don’t need to wait hours for your help.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The project is a two weeks longs effort, and you should start working on it from day one. Some of the students in the class use the office hours every week so I do not think it will be useful to have office hours every other week. I understand it can be frustrating waiting for your turn on discord, but my suggestion would be to start early working as early as possible so that you could ask questions over two weeks rather than all of the questions on the week when the project is due.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Should we use arrays in graphing from now on, or are there certain times to use lists?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Very likely we will use arrays more than lists.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is there a way to do overlapping graphs on matplotlib?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Just use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">plt.plot()</span></code> twice</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How do you relabel the x, y axis without affecting the points plotted?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">plt.xticks</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">plt.yticks</span></code></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>how many step we usually use for plot a graph by using x=np.linspace(-1,1,step)?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It depends from the application. I would say 101 is a good number to start with, then you can increase/decrease based on the accuracy you are looking for</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can we do both of these projects? (not at once)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately we will have time for only one of them</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How is the extra credit weighted?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Do you mean for project 3? It will count as a bonus for project 4</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In what instances are lists better than arrays?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have something that does not have a fixed dimension or if you need a container for variables of different type.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What is the numerical equivalent for an A+, A, A-, B+, B, etc. on a project?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A: 97, A-:92, B+:88.5, B:85,</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Now that we are half way through the semester, are the grades where you expected them to be?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Every year is different. But i can say that the grades of project 2 are closer to what I expected</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can we possibly talk about defining variables a bit.  In other languages the variable type has to be specified, I was wondering if you could do this in python so it would be more clear when inputting parameters to your functions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There is a way to declare variable type, but pythoon idea is to avoid that to give more flexibility.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will you explain more information about the matrix? I am still a little bit confused. Thank you</p></li>
</ul>
<p>sure. We will use multidimensional arrays for project 4 as well.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What should we do if our python crashes if we try to graph more points? The code works for less points.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It might very likely be because your code is not vectorized. One solution would be to try to make the code more efficient.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What is the best way to organize the project reports, I want to get as much points in documentation as I can</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You should read the project report section on the class website.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I’m still not completely familiar with arrays, can you talk a bit more about them? I know all we did really was work on the project this week, so I don’t have any major questions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We will talk about arrays more this week. You should also stop by office hours if you are struggling with arrays.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Expain the idea of reshaping</p></li>
</ul>
<p>we are changing the array dimension.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Are we going to do 3D animation using python?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>No. But we will use 2d animations in project 4</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I still have had trouble graphing arrays with linspace under specific parameters and am concerned about how should I handle them?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You should stop by office hours.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>are using booleans better than the true, false, condition statements?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is faster with boolean indeces.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For the colorbar graphs, are they used in “real world” math? I feel like they can get too clustered if there are too many numbers in them or are they used to just see patterns?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes they are. They could be useful to see pattern and analyze data in the 2d format.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="week-6">
<h2>Week 6<a class="headerlink" href="#week-6" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will we ever learn how to turn our projects in executables?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Not in the class, but I’ll be happy to talk about this at office hours</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What does “which root different points in a rectangular portion of the complex plane converge to for the equation” from project 3 mean? Should the graph be 3D with real complex and approximate root?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Will talk more about this on Monday</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is there a particular reason we haven’t discussed dictionaries yet? Will we discuss them later?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We will talk about dictionaries later in the semester</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Would you recommend always using numpy when working with series from this point on or would it still be beneficial at times to do what we’ve been doing when it applies, if so, when should we use our old ways?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It depends on the application. If you are doing the same opearation on several points, numpy will be faster.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Should we be using subplots in most projects, or should we use them only when we feel they will be most helpful?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is up to you. If it can be useful I would use a subplot instead of two separate plots.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Are there other popular math libraries than matplotlib and numpy? Those are normally the only 2 I see.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are simpy and scipy that I know of, but I am pretty sure there are several more.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can you explain more on use of numpy array and also the use of the linspace</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We can talk a little about it in class.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Would you be able to go more in depth regarding the project, as well as arrays? I know you can add things to lists (.append) but you said you can’t add elements to an array. Would you be able to describe when we should use lists and when we should use arrays?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll talk more about the project on Monday. arrays are very convenient when you are performing the same operation on multiple points.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will you be covering more of how the graph will be constructed for project 3?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>yes</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Do you recommend that we import the specific functions of numpy that we need or all of it?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Import all of numpy with the nickname np</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will there be any requirements for code running speed in the future? since we learned the more efficient way to calculate.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>No. But I expect that you learn how to code in a relative efficient way (for example using arrays instead of lists when appropriate)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will we be using arrays instead of lists for the rest of the semester or are there some other things that lists are better at?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We will be using both.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How do I determine the tolerance for project 3? Is there a formula or just a random number?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll talk about it on Monday</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I’m still a little confused about how we’re plotting complex roots on a graph and how to generalize the function in part 2. Could you explain this again?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, will do on Monday</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>This project seems a lot harder than the first two, will the projects continue to be increasingly challenging?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Not necessarily. Each project will explore a new aspect of python.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Why are we using numpy? I know that it is widely used, but does it have specific attributes or codes, persay, that are quicker than matplotlib? Obviously, np.linspace made the iterations extremely easy to plot, but are there other things that we’ve done previously that numpy can compute quicker or with less lines of code?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We are using numpy mostrly for efficiency and becuase the code would be more neat and easier to read/write in some cases. There might be more examples.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For quiz 6 question 3, I use x=np.array(range(-2,2,101)) , with start to end and number of step, it did not come out as what i expect , then I use x=np.linspace(), the output is what I expect. So I am wondering is np.array(range()) can not use to find start to end with certain number of step, or am I typing the wrong thing inside the bracket?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">np.linspace(start,end,p)</span></code> will create the array from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">start</span></code> to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">end</span></code> with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">p</span></code> points. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">np.arange(s,e,ss)</span></code> will create and array from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">s</span></code> to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">e</span></code> (not included) with a step size of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ss</span></code></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For the project part 2 , you said different initial points should mark colors after 100 iterations. But I do not know how to using different color and plot on the graph, could you explain more about this?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">plt.imshow()</span></code> will take care of that. We will talk more about it on Monday</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is it possible to have a legend for the snail project? When I tried it listed prime twice, (once for 2 and 3) and then once for composite and one.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You might have to be careful the way you are selecting it.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How do we plot multiple horizontal/vertical lines across specific points using matplotlib?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You need the line equation, and then you can use arrays.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How often will we use complex numbers?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Just for project 3</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is their an easier way to produce more complex subplots?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Easier than what? The question is not clear.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What are the differences between the numpy array and a matrix? is one more beneficial than the other?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The “matrix” is a multidimensional version of the array.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is it still possible to secure a B or higher in this class if the first two project were less than steller.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We would have to look at the math (come to office hours)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>is there a way to do vector addition with arrays ?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">+</span></code></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can you explain more on display the convergence in the next lecture?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For the In box 73 on the week 6 python, I’m confused on whats going on. I understand reshaping and that stuff but I just don’t get what happened.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We create <cite>y</cite> as a 5x2 array. Then we set a 5x2 slice of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a</span></code> equal to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">y</span></code></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="week-5">
<h2>Week 5<a class="headerlink" href="#week-5" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How do you graph something in a different color for the length primedec snail graph? would I need to generate a list of all different sizes before plotting it?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to do it with one single plot command, yes.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is the class generally curved at the end, or are the cutoffs in the syllabus set in stone?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It depends. The cutoff might be a litte flexible.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>will the coming projects be as challenging to code as the snail pattern was? do the projects just become progressively more difficult where the ideas build on each other or are we covering varying math properties for each? Do the project generally get harder throughout the semester, or are they just relating to the different things we learn?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Some might be. The projects will touch different areas of math and their difficulty will vary.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can you specify exactly what you want in the quizzes.  For example in the most recent one, it says import matplotlib which made me think that it was assumed however a point was taken off because it was not in my code block?  Thank you</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In that quiz I explicitly asked to import matplotlib. The sentence was not all in a code block (gray background), so that was not a python code instruction. In other questions I wrote “assume this code has been run”.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In regards to subplots, I have been having trouble plotting them. Would you be able to go over changing the arguments in the plt.subplot() function and what they represent? Can we do more about subplot? Will you go over and providing more details about the subplot?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll see more on Monday</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>within a plot, how do you add text for the marker except for dots? (the example used for the snail grid in project two)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>plt.text()</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For matplotlib.pyplot will we explore more into using for loops and more that could be implemented into some of our projects?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We will see more functionalities of matpltlib as we proceed with the course.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I was wondering if you’d go over the real problems the projects are based on once we complete them? It’d be very interesting to know about.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I can do that. Just remind me in class.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Was an A on the first assignment an actual A or was it a generous A (like you said some projects were F’s but to be generous you gave D’s, does the same apply for the A’s given out)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>An A was an actual A.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is it good practice to include an import in a function? For example, including import math as mat in a function.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Unless in very specific cases, it usually is good practice to have all of the import commands at the beginning of your file.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will we cover the primed(n) function in class next week because  struggled when creating the function?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You should stop by office hours to discuss this.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>what is the difference between scatter and plot? I can do the same graph with this two different plot</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can get the same graph with both commands. scatter is in general to plot point with no line connecting them</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I am doing practice on something similar to the number spiral introduce in project 2. I am creating a matrix for the number, I had written out the direction of how the number goes but I don’t know how to make it as a matrix form. Could you give me some idea?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll be happy to talk more about this at office hours. So you can explain me the problem directly.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is the grade for this class going to be curved? or is it based on class performance?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The grade is based on calss performance.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If plotting to look for patterns like we did in projects, what would you suggest is a good range of numbers? Like 1000, higher or lower?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It depends from the project. You should try different ranges and see if one or more give you some patterns</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>is there a way to better the grade i received on project 1?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As I said in class, there will be 7 or 8 projects in total. The grade of a single project is not that important compared to all of the others. Focus on the new projects, and try your best.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>how would we shorthand the three elif statements? I’m assuming that since there is a way to do list comprehension that there must be a way to define the function with one statement instead of repeating some of the factors involved for every elif statement.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Is this relative to the snail? You can use some algebra to find a pattern. I’ll talk a little about it in class.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What would happen to our participation if we accidentally disconnect in the middle of lecture but reconnect?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>nothing. Issue with connection can happen. As long as you re-connect within a few minutes your grade will not be influenced.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is this class curved because how can I keep up. And can I resubmit project one?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The class is not curved. There are no make-up projects or re-do. As I said in class, there will be 7 or 8 projects in total. The grade of a single project is not that important compared to all of the others. Focus on the new projects, and try your best.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How do you more easily access a previously written function in your plots with matplotlib.pyplot?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Not clear what the question is.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How many projects will be weighed for the midterm grade?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Probably the first 2</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is there a way to make a list of numbers to a certain decimal place without dividing?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>numpy. We’ll see it on Monday</p>

<li><p>Will we get to the point of object oriented programming in this, class?  I am looking to learn it and I was hoping we get that far.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>no.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I am confused as to how to calculate the decomposition of a number, and how to plot numbers with a spiral pattern.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>will talk more about project 2 on Monday</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Regarding to the last topic of subplots, will these be used in the project this upcoming week or is it just a topic that we will learn for later use in the class?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>they could be useful in several projects if you want two or more graphs next to each other</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will graphing be used in most projects?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>yes</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How come my attendance percentage is 99.8% and not 100%?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A very similar question was asked in week 3, look for the answer below.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What is a good way to guarantee that you do well on projects?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Review the rubric to check that everytihng required is there. Look at the feedback that i gave you on the past projects.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>is the time we get to do the project related to the level of difficulty?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>not clear what you are asking</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is there a way to plot pie graphs and histograms in python?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>yes. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bar</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pie</span></code> from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">matplotlib</span></code></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How do we graph numbers instead of points on a graph for the second project?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You do not need to graph numbers. the graph on the project page is there to show you the pattern. However you can use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">plt.text</span></code></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can you explain more on plotting and writing in detail each of the type or every element means? Can you explain more about the project? Because I am still not sure what we need to do</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Can you go over more examples that are related towards project 2? How should I start thinking about the snail graph? Is there a correlation between that and prime numbers?</p>
<p>We will talk more about project 2 in week 5</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>“Will you go over the project after it due?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I plan to show you some good and bad examples from your submissions of project 1</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will you extend the quiz time because it is kind of hard to double check the answer.”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I believe the quiz time is already enough. You should use the practice quiz as practice. Time to double check your answers is not included.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Why are points taken off for syntax errors on the weekly quiz? I do not understand the idea behind this, as I think focusing on the material/concepts is more important.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For the same reason for which you lose points in math exams for computational mistakes, even if the topic of the class is not algebra. If you do not know the syntaz properly, your code will be full of errors, and you coding will not be efficient. Think what would happen if every time you do some computations you did a mistake. The idea is similar</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For class next week are we going over the three different functions for project two?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>yes</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>when can we get project 1 feedback ? because I am not sure if I have met all project requirements. If not, I can do some changes on project 2.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Just sent to you via email (Sunday evening)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I am just a little confused as to how the sublot correlates to plt.plot.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>subplot creates the space (table) for plotting more than one graph on the same image.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What is the difference between jupyter lab and notebook? They seem very similar?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>They are pretty similar. Jupyter notebook is suggested as the tool to start from.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How would you do 3d graphs in matplotlib?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://matplotlib.org/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/tutorial.html">here</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/04.12-three-dimensional-plotting.html">here</a> with the help of google</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>“How much outside stuff can we use? And are lectures posted rather than just the code?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The lectures are posted on UBLearns as said on the class website (the same question was asked in week 1 - see below). <strong>Code from outside -&gt; None</strong>. You can use external sources for citations but you need to properly reference them.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How would we use break/continue in loops within list comprehension? Just add it towards the end appropriately like we do with multiple line codes?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We do not. There are some complex way of getting to a similar result. In that case though, I would not use list comprehension.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In class you used “from math import sin, cos, etc. Can you just import math as <em>blank</em> like we do with plotting?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We saw that in class <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">import</span> <span class="pre">math</span> <span class="pre">as</span> <span class="pre">m</span></code></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is there a more efficient way to find if a number is prime?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe. I am open to ideas</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For the project do we need to create the functions that you suggested in order to create the properly working function or can we go another route?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You need to show that you can create those functions. Then if you wan to tgo a different way you can, but be sure to explain it well</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>what are some ways to be creative with coding. i find myself not being able to come up with responses as quickly as my classmates and im wondering if i am behind the pace of the course</p></li>
</ul>
<p>reading books about coding is useful. ‘Automate the boring stuff with python’ is an interesting one. Practice is important to get better. I would not worry too much about being the first to answer questions, what is important is that you can stay up to speed with the class material</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How does the zig zag plot work? Would you use figsize to also resize the comparison plots (the four we did side by side)?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>we can talk about this in class.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When using figsize, what do the two numbers mean? I thought it was the dimensions of the graph but, looking at some graphs, that doesn’t appear to be true.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>width and height of the figure</p>

<div class="section" id="week-3">
<h2>Week 3<a class="headerlink" href="#week-3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will we be using indexing to perform certain operations on different parts of the same matrix?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>yes. We will be using indexing more often as we proceed with the course. We will mostly use it with arrays (not introduced yet) and lists</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is there any good resources to get more help with latex syntax?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://tug.ctan.org/info/short-math-guide/short-math-guide.pdf">here</a></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How come a list of numbers is sometimes shown vertically and sometimes shown horizontally? If I recall correctly, if I don’t print the list, it’s shown vertically. Is this because it’s treated as a column vector in that case?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Using the print() function will print it in a better form.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I’m used to writing types like string x = “string” but python doesnt really have that option, when writing functions how can we differentiate which parameter is what when passing in arguments? Ex with your volume(x,y) is there a way to differentiate which one gets squared  while you’re using the function or is that what comments are for?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Python allows for more flexibility than say C++ or Java, so you do not have to define the variable type when crating a variable. In the same fashion a function does not need to know the variable type. The same function might be used with different variables. To differentiate which variable is which you might assign them via keyword.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I feel comfortable with the material and everything you go over has made sense so far but I have not done well on the quizzes because of the time.  I was wondering what the average of the quiz because I want to see if I am behind the class in terms of quiz grades.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The average for quiz 2 and 3 is 7.3 and 7 respectively.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Are we allowed to use additional sources (and their code) for things like plotting graphs, or creating tables etc. as long as we cite them as a source in our projects?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You are allowed to use external resources and you must cite them properly. However you cannot submit code that is not yours. For example using a built-in function that I did not show in class, like for example plt.grid() to add a grid to your plot and make it nicer is OK. But submitting code that create the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">single_step()</span></code> function taken from online, is NOT OK even if you properly cite it.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When plotting in matplotlib, is there any way of changing the colors of the main title or axis titles?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">plt.title('pippo',color='r')</span></code>
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">plt.xticks(color='b')</span></code></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Are there other ways to graph in Python besides matplotlib? Are there other visual aids that we will learn in the future? (similar to plotting a graph)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>yes! we will see some of them later in the course.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will each project be graded more strictly as the semester goes on?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>No. I am usually more lenient with the first one (since it’s the first one) but in general the metric is always the same. One thing that I will keep an eye out for would be repeated mistakes, though.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>im not sure if it has been presented  on the course website but is there a rubric for the projects and how they will be graded.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="report_guide.html"><span class="doc">Project Report Guide</span></a></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Could you please go over more about the plot? because that was too fast to catch up. Can you show more example and explanation about creating plot? I have confusion with how to insert x and y and how to create a graph with function. Some of the plotting commands are a little muddled and confusing to me, is there any way to understand them more easily?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>yes, I can spend some time on Monday.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is there such thing as a project which is too long? For example, will I get points taken away for having a drawn out answer. I ask because I want to include enough information to get a good grade but not too much where it is not beneficial to me.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There is no such thing as a project that is too long :)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>what situation(s) would mutable or non-mutable objects be used?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you need to build a variable that should not be changed, it should be a non-mutable object (for example a tuple over a list)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>“what is the different between () and [], like the example in the class, a=[1,2,3] and a=(1,2,3), so in what situation I should use those two?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The one with brackets is a list, the one with parenthesis is a tuple. Tuples are non-mutable. The question above as more info.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>another question is what is tuples mean? I not understand.”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A tuple is a non-mutalbe list</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In the below part– When we are plotting using matplotlib and creating legends, does it automatically create legends for plots sequentially? Do we not have to assign plots to specific titles in the legend?”</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>plt.plot([1,2,3],[2,4,8],&#39;gs-&#39;) # k is black, g, r ,b, y
plt.plot([1,2,3],[2,8,6],&#39;k--&#39;)
plt.plot([1,2,3],[2,7,9],&#39;m:&#39;)
plt.plot([1,2,3],[2,5,3],&#39;r.&#39;)
plt.plot([2],[8],&#39;b*&#39;)
plt.legend([&#39;green&#39;,&#39;black&#39;,&#39;magenta&#39;,&#39;red&#39;,&#39;blue&#39;])``
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You can either do the legend at the end, or add it to every plot with the argument <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">label</span></code> directly in the plot command. In that case you will need to run <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">plt.legend()</span></code> for the legend to be visible.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How do i import different packages into python?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>with an import statement. We have seen that in week 1 and 2</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Why is my participation grade always dropping when I come to class and do the weekly summary?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The participation grade that you get an email about every week, accounts for your class attendance to our zoom classes. If you join a few minutes late, that might cause your score to drop a little. Any final score above 95% will be considered as full attendance.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can you go over how to add the spell checker into python?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are some instructions for this on discord (in the class server). I’ll be also happy to help at office hours</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can we get more outside practice problems or links. Also maybe I need to keep pace but there has to be a way for me to be competitive with the other students who clearly have a python background.</p></li>
<li><p>I am confused about question 7 on quiz 4. If we create two arguments and call a function with a different number of arguments, that is an error. How should I fix this?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>One way is to set one of the arguments to a default value. that way calling the function with only one argument won’t give an error.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If you were to use the mylist.pop command, is there a way to use the command and not completely delete a whole section of the list. What I mean is for example, in class, we removed purple from the list. Lets say in the same list there was also blue and green. Could you delete purple and green using mylist.pop?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes. In case of nested lists you would need to call the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pop</span></code> command on the nested list. I can show an example in class. (please remind me if I forget)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is python the best tool to use for computations? Can sequences be an ordered list of pairs of numbers?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Python is free, very versatile and user friendly. This makes it a very well spread compiting language. Depending on what computations you are planning it might or might not be the best one. The second question is not completely clear. Do you mean a list whose elements are ordered pairs? That can be done in python.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When is our next project?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The next project will be introduced in week 4, and will be due at the end of week 5.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="week-2">
<h2>Week 2<a class="headerlink" href="#week-2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For the gradescope quizzes, will you post a document with the answers? (So that we will be able to see what we were missing or did incorrectly)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I will not post the answers to the quiz, but I’ll be happy to discuss the quiz at office hours if something about the grading/answer is not clear. Also you can always paste your code in the jupyter-notebook to run it and check if it produces the desired output.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will run time be an issue for future project/functions? Things are easier with loops but they also increase runtime by a significant amount. Maybe you can go over ways to optimize looping or something like that</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We will see a few ways to avoid too many loops. I will not grade your code for efficency (or execution speed). All of the projects we will work on should have a reasonable run time (of the order of minutes/seconds)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I think I may have missed it in class, but how much is the analysis portion of the project going to typically be worth? Also, how in depth do we need to go with the analysis?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The analysis/narrative portion of the project is officially worth 40% of your grade (more details are <a class="reference external" href="./_static/rubric337.pdf">here</a>). However as marked in the rubric a project with no analysis could get a lower grade than the actual average grade. How deep the analysis? There isn’t a binary answer to that, but I expect that all of the results that you presented are analyzed, and you do a reasonable amount of work.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If I execute an infinite while loop, is there anyway to stop my computer from over heating without quickly saving my progress and then exiting out of anaconda navigator and python all together?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can select the cell that is runnig, and push the stop button from the menu in the jupyter notebook. (I’ll show you on Monday what I mean)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will we have time in class to go over every project or just for the first one?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We will have some time for all of the projects, but you are expected to also work outside of class time.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Does this course get exponentially more difficult, or is it consistent difficulty throughout, or somewhere in between or totally different?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Somewhere in between. We will learn more things as we the semester proceeds, so there will be more tool to be used. The complexity of the project will be different from project to project, depending on th etools necessary. Also I have learned that the project difficulty is extremely subjective to the students.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Do you mind telling us when we will be doing groupwork because I normally study in the silent part of the library so I have to find a new spot when we do.  Thank you!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The plan is to have group work at every class.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>how do you determine whether a <cite>while</cite> loop or <cite>for…in</cite> loop is more useful? If there is a scenario where both for and while loops are acceptable, how do we choose the more optimal one?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I will talk a little about this in class. In general I use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">for</span></code> loops prevalently when I know exactly how long I have to loop for, whereas <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">while</span></code> loops are useful if you have to loop ‘as long as’ some condition is True. (This is not a complete answer)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>what is the different between string and print? In what situation I need use string/print?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">string</span></code> is a variable type containing characters. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Print</span></code> is a python function that will print to screen.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How do we indent in the gradescope quiz when writing code? Tab doesn’t work for me.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Just put a few spaces</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In what situation should we use return, break and continue? Can you explain more on the while function like how do we use it for? I’m so confused about break and continue. could you go over them again? where should i place the “return” when I def a function?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">return</span></code> is used in functions to return the function output. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">break</span></code> is used to stop loops, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">continue</span></code> is used to skip a single iteration. (Will  talk more in class)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For the project, will there be specific names for the functions you expect us to use or are we allowed to name them and then just have a comment to define what it is?   For the project are we supposed to have a comment alongside each line of code or only when necessary along with the description cell prior?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can use the names that you prefer. Your code should have comments where they are necessary. Image that you are giving your repost to somebody who knows a little bit of python, but is not in the class. Your code comments should guide the reader through your code, explaining the steps in your code.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>what is your first step when you receive the problem? I alway do not know how to start when i doing the problem.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I ususally try to think of the steps that I need to take to solve it, and I try to write them down in pseudo-code.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Even though I can understand “list” “range” “for loop” and other content how they work, it is hard for me to apply these to solve problems by myself. do you have any suggestion?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Office hours are a good place to ask these kind of questions. Also Wehn working in groups you can discuss with your groupmates to formulate the solution together.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is that possible extending the quiz time? because i have no time to double check the answer. Can you make the quiz shorter or giving more time to us? I had took a look and do practice on the sample quiz but I still felt like I don’t have enough time to think of the question.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, I can  extend the time or I will make the quiz slightly shorter.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will we ever use some of the more complex logical operators such as XOR or shifting?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Probably not</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How do I make conditions for even or odd integers?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What number divides even numbers evenly? We will talk about this a little bit more in class.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Are indentations kind of like sectioning off the code?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>yes. It organizes the code</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is it possible to nest a while loop into a for loop?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>yes</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How do you decide the background image?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All of the pictures are from places I have been to. All of the pictures have been taken by either myself or my wife. I change the picture from the zoom menu</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can we have some help links to follow also. I feel like i need to catch up because theres definently more experinced people in the class</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are some links on the class website and in the weekly schedule tab. I’ll be happy to help at office hours as well.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will you go over numpy and matplotlib?  When will we need to use them?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes. We will use matplotlib in almost all the projects (including project 1). numpy will be introduced in a few weeks</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will there be a project where we must work in groups?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There will not be group projects, but you are allowed to work together to some parts of the projects, as long as you submit your own material.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will all of the projects be written using python?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>yes, this is a python course</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="week-1">
<h2>Week 1<a class="headerlink" href="#week-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will we be using anything else other than Jupyter Notebook and if so what will it be?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>No, we will just use the notebook as it will allow us to combine code and text</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will we be sent emails of when the projects are posted? What will the weekly schedule show? We will be able to see deadlines/due dates?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The projects are introduced in class, and the website will be updated accordingly with deadlines and weekly schedule.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How many projects will there be throughout the semester?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>from 7 to up tp 10 depending on how the semester evolves</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For the if, then print part of coding that we covered, if you want to compute a list of n/d do you need to input n and d every time or is there a shortcut where python can do that? Like say a table of values that python can then take the numbers from?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Good question! python offers a few ways to loop through a set of values. We will see more of this in week 2</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If we watch and participate in all lectures, should the projects be relatively easy?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We will work in class to some parts of te projects, so participating to the lecture will help for sure.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Do you have any suggested methods for studying for quizzes or succeeding with projects?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For the quizzes, the practice quiz and asking questions should help.</p>
<p>For the projects I’ll answer with more details in class.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Are there any websites you might recommend that would give good advice on coding similar to the class, other than the notes from Prof. Cunningham?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Google is usually a good palce to start. The <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/">python documentation page</a> might also be a good place (maybe a littel overwhelming at first)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When the course starts to pick up a little, what is the highest level of code we will be doing?  I have only taken CSE 115 so I am not the best coder in the world, is that going to be alright?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The level of coding will grow as the semester proceeds. However, no prior programming experience is assumed for this class. So we will build up all of the necessary tools together.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I am wondering how you are able to have line numbers show up on Jupyter Notebook, because for me it doesn’t, even though I installed the latest version. I also remember you talking about the difference between the green and blue on the left side of the code/markdown, but I do not remember exactly why that was important.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The line numbers are a jupyter notebook extension (we will talk about it on week 2). Blue cells are not active, green cells are active.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How in depth does the class go regarding the mathematics aspect? Are we going to be doing any calculus within Python, for example? Will we be designing our own functions (i.e. defined functions) or are we only going to be using what Python and other libraries have already developed?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We will cover some mathematics in the course, but if i need a specific topic, I will cover it not giving it for granted. We will design functions and used several libraries</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Are you allowed to have variables in between the $$’s? ex  $$var$$  where var is 5</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Can you be more specifc about this question via email?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What are some of the limitations to python?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Not super efficient compared to other coding languages</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For the projects, do we find a problem to solve, or are we given a problem?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I will give you the problem</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is this class considered object oriented programming?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>no</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I am new with La Tex, I cannot follow sometimes during classes like after the code be executed then I cannot see the original code. (Then I will lose lol)  2. Is there a way I can see the code that you wrote during classes?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Just ask me during the lecture and I can show the code again. You can also reach out via email after class, or come to office hours.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How do you determine which students to give extra credit to? Is it relative to other students’ work or based on a personal standard?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Based on your participation in the class, and based on the quality of your work</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>what is the different between using math import and math import * and what is the easier way to use it? I am confused with the import statement. Sometimes I saw you type from (something) import (something), and sometimes you just type import (something). Do these two bring the same result?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I will answer in class.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What is the difficulty level of projects?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll see :).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>From past experience, what aspect of this class do you believe is that students struggle with the most?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The narrative/organization component of the projects</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I saw the sample quiz2 and I was wondering how we are going to submit the codes to the Graderscop?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Type it in text boxes.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will the notes as well as the lecture video be uploaded after each class?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>They are. Notes are on the <a class="reference internal" href="weekly_schedule.html"><span class="doc">Weekly Schedule</span></a> tab, videos are on UBLearns -&gt; Tools -&gt; Panopto Content</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In class, you show some of your code as examples or notes and such. Will your coding files be posted somewhere as .ipynb on ublearns, or the course website, or will the code only be accessible through the recordings?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>see above</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What is the topic for the first project report?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="Projects/part_sequence/part_sequence.html"><span class="doc">here</span></a></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>matplotlib does not import for me through juputyer notebook. is there a step that i missed in importing or configuring juputyer notebook?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What do you mean? I might be able to help you more specifically at office hours.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How much coding will there be in this course? Is Python the only coding language that we will be learning in a math setting?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A significant amoutn. Python will be the major focus.</p>
