Example: Code structure
_______________________

**Bad:** The example below includes a long block of Python code which defines a few functions
and also prints and plots some data. It takes effort to unravel what this code does.

   <a href = "../_static/report_guide/report_sample7a.html">
   <img src="../_static/report_guide/report_sample7a.png" style="padding:1px; border:2px solid #C4C4C4; display: block;" width="850">
   </a>



**Good:** The same code as above is split into a few code cells. Beside simplifying the code structure
it is easier to explain in this setting what is the purpose of each bit of code.
