**Bad:** The plot has no title and axes don't have labels.
There are several curves in this plot (each corresponding to a different value of a parameter),
but all of them are plotted using the same color and there is no indication which value of the parameter gives which curve.

**Good:** The plot has a descriptive title and its axes have labels.
Each curve in the plot has a distinctive color, and the legend explains which color
corresponds to which value of the parameter.
