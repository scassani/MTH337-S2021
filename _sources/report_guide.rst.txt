Project Report Guide
====================

Collaboration
--------------

You are free to discuss projects with your classmates. However, each project report
must be solely your own work: it must be written by you in its entirety, including
all computer code. **Plagiarism of any kind** (copying from other students, or permitting someone to copy your work, copying from the internet etc.) **will result at the minimum in the failing grade on a report, and possibly in additional sanctions** (an F grade for the course, an academic disciplinary action etc.).
**Discussing projects with students that have already taken the class is not allowed, and is considered cheating.**


Using external resources
------------------------

There are plenty of books and websites devoted to Python programming. You should take advantage of this. If you have a programming question then in most cases a quick google search will
get you an answer. You are not allowed to copy code you found online and use it in your reports.

Most of the projects you will be working on are based on mathematical
problems and ideas that are described somewhere. However, you **should not** start your
work on a project by doing a web or library search. The goal of each project is for
you to **explore a problem on your own**. Have fun, explore, and put in the report what you came up with.


In the narrative of a report you can insert a brief quote from some source if you find it useful, as long as you provide a proper attribution. Quotes used without an attribution are an instance of plagiarism. Long quotes - e.g. using a few paragraphs from Wikipedia for the report introduction - will decrease the value of your report, even if they are attributed.





Additional Python features
--------------------------

We will not be able to cover all features of Python in this course. You are free
(and encouraged!) to explore additional Python tools on your own and use them in
your code. The only condition is that you must understand your own code and be able
to explain it in detail if asked. You must not copy code snippets that you found
somewhere and that somehow seem to be doing what you need.

**I reserve the right to ask questions on submitted work to verify ownership of code.**


Report grading rubrics
----------------------

The detailed rubric that will be used to grade the reports is avaialble `here <./_static/rubric337.pdf>`_


Report Style Guide
------------------


Report introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A report must begin with an introduction section. It should explain the project
and the goals of the report in a way which is engaging and understandable to
a student who has some math background, but does not take this course.  

Introduction should not be limited to a list of tasks you want to accomplish.
While explaining the project use your own words, **do not copy the project
description** from the class website.

   Example <./Report_guide/report6>


Report conclusions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The final section of the report must summarize your results and conclusions.


Report organization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Beside the sections with introduction and conclusions the body of the
report should be logically organized into sections reflecting its content.



References
~~~~~~~~~~

If you used books, articles, websites etc. while preparing the report they should
be listed at the end of the report.



Math formatting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use LaTeX to format all mathematical symbols and formulas.

   Example <./Report_guide/report4>



Code structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python code should be split into possibly short code cells that accomplish a single,
well defined task.  In particular you should not define several functions in one cell
or define a function and execute it in the same cell.

You should explain (even if very briefly) the purpose of each piece of code. As a rule,
you should not have in a report two consecutive code cells without any text between them.

   Example <./Report_guide/report7>


Code sequencing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All Python code in the report must be entered in such order that it can be read
and executed sequentially, from the beginning to the end of the report. For example,
you should not use a Python function in your report prior to defining this function.

Code comments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Code comments should be used to explain workings of the code.

Execution errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All code included in your report must work. Do not submit reports with execution errors.

   Example <./Report_guide/report8>


Output size
~~~~~~~~~~~

Your report should contain only code output that serves some purpose
and that you expect someone to read. As a general rule, do not print more
than 30 lines of output unless you have a good reason for it.

   Example <./Report_guide/report1>


Output formatting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Format code output in a way that makes it easy to read.

Graphs and plots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Graphs and plots must be well formatted. They should have titles and, if appropriate,  axis labels, a legend etc.
