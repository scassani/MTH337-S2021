Project
~~~~~~~

**Part 1.** For each of these texts perform the following tasks:

* Create a list of several (20 or so) words most frequently appearing in the text.

* Plot frequencies of all words appearing in the text against their ranks in
  the frequency order.

**Part 2.** Analyze differences and similarities between lists of most frequent words
and plots of words frequencies for all of these texts. Describe any patterns you see.


If you want to expand your research to additional texts you can use

Project Gutenberg files or other online resources. Use ``requests`` to retrieve
these additional files so they are accessible when you submit the report.
