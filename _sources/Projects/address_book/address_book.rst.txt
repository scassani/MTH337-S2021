Address Book
============

.. rubric:: (due: Saturday, May 1 at 8:00 AM)

The `Faculty and Staff Directory <http://pharmacy.buffalo.edu/faculty-staff.html>`_
webpage of the UB School of Pharmacy lists names of faculty and staff members of
the school. The name of each person is linked to a webpage with information about
that person.


Project
-------

Using requests and regular expressions write code that retrieves name, office
address, phone number, and e-mail of each person listed in the staff and faculty
directory. Your code should print this information for each person (in alphabetical
order) in a format similar to the following:

|

.. container:: output

    Brown, Alice
    
    B5-123A NYS Center of Excellence
    
    Buffalo, NY
    
    (716) 555-1234
    
    abrown123\@buffalo.edu

|

.. container:: output

    Chase, Joseph
    
    555 Kapoor Hall
    
    Buffalo, NY 14214-8033
    
    (716) 555-3210
    
    josech\@buffalo.edu

|

The sample listings above are made up, they do not correspond to the real information
posted on the School of Pharmacy website.



**Note 1.**  Reports that print contact information that was manually entered into
the report code are not acceptable.

**Note 2.** Your code needs to handle the following issues:


* Individual pages of some people are missing some or all contact information.
  In such cases the listing you produce should indicate it e.g. as follows:

|

.. container:: output

    Brown, Alice
    
    No Address
    
    (716) 555-1234
    
    abrown123\@buffalo.edu

|

.. container:: output

    Chase, Joseph
    
    No Address
    
    No Phone
    
    No E-mail

|


* The number of lines in the office address can vary, depending on a person.

* Phone numbers are listed on web pages in different formats:
  `(716) 555-1234 <http://pharmacy.buffalo.edu/content/pharmacy/faculty-staff/faculty/faculty-profile.html?ubit=npaolini>`_, `(716)555-1234 <http://pharmacy.buffalo.edu/content/pharmacy/faculty-staff/faculty/faculty-profile.html?ubit=rda>`_,
  or `716-555-1234 <http://pharmacy.buffalo.edu/content/pharmacy/faculty-staff/faculty/faculty-profile.html?ubit=necieri>`_,
  or `716.555.1234 <http://pharmacy.buffalo.edu/content/pharmacy/faculty-staff/faculty/faculty-profile.html?ubit=mayahols>`_, or `7165551234 <http://pharmacy.buffalo.edu/content/pharmacy/faculty-staff/faculty/faculty-profile.html?ubit=mpk5>`_
  etc. Your code should capture all phone numbers regardless how they were entered,
  and print them out in the format (716) 555-1234.

**Note 3.**  This is a programming project. Your project report does not need
include narrative, beyond comments explaining how your code works. The project will
be graded according to the following rubrics:

* Code that successfully decrypts the text file: 70%
* Report organization and code documentation: 30%
