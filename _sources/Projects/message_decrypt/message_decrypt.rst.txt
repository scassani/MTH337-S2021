Message decryption
==================

.. rubric:: (due: Friday, April 9, 11:59 PM)


Message encryption is necessary to ensure safe transmission of data.

Messages can be encrypted by a subsitution of characters in the message.

Consider the example: "Luke, I am your father"

The encryption is done following these steps:

-  A numerical value is assigned to each character. For these project we will only consider the following characters

``ABCDEFGHIJKLMONPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmonpqrstuvwxyz 0123456789.,:;<>?!()\n``

-  A word is chosen as the encryption **key**, say *Pizza* is our key. Following the table above

-  The message is also changed to numbers following the table

-  The message and the key are aligned and added.

- Any number outside the [0,73] interval is brought back into the interval, using the mod division, and then a letter is associated to each number to obtain the encrypted message.

**Encrypted message**: "aGOHQ<qdD,<KQX?<:DW6tD"

Project
-------

Each file listed below contains text (a fragment of a book in English)
encrypted using the method described above choosing the **key** at random among the words in the file :download:`keys.txt<keys.txt>`. 

Write a function **decrypt('txtfile')** that decrypts the file assigned to you and print the decrypted message. The function should take as a variable the name of your .txt file.

A dictionary of English words is available here :download:`dictionary<dictionary.txt>`


**Note.**  This is a programming project. Your project report does not need
include narrative, beyond comments explaining how your code works. The project will
be graded according to the following rubrics:

* Code correctness and completeness: 80%
* Report organization and code documentation: 20%
