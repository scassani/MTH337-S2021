Answers to Weekly Summary questions
===================================

Week 4
~~~~~~

* Will we get to the point of object oriented programming in this, class?  I am looking to learn it and I was hoping we get that far.

no.

* I am confused as to how to calculate the decomposition of a number, and how to plot numbers with a spiral pattern. 

will talk more about project 2 on Monday

* Regarding to the last topic of subplots, will these be used in the project this upcoming week or is it just a topic that we will learn for later use in the class?

they could be useful in several projects if you want two or more graphs next to each other

* Will graphing be used in most projects?

yes

* How come my attendance percentage is 99.8% and not 100%? 

A very similar question was asked in week 3, look for the answer below.
 
* What is a good way to guarantee that you do well on projects?

Review the rubric to check that everytihng required is there. Look at the feedback that i gave you on the past projects.

* is the time we get to do the project related to the level of difficulty? 

not clear what you are asking

* Is there a way to plot pie graphs and histograms in python? 

yes. ``bar`` and ``pie`` from ``matplotlib``

* How do we graph numbers instead of points on a graph for the second project?

You do not need to graph numbers. the graph on the project page is there to show you the pattern. However you can use ``plt.text``

* Can you explain more on plotting and writing in detail each of the type or every element means? Can you explain more about the project? Because I am still not sure what we need to do
Can you go over more examples that are related towards project 2? How should I start thinking about the snail graph? Is there a correlation between that and prime numbers? 

We will talk more about project 2 in week 5

* "Will you go over the project after it due?

I plan to show you some good and bad examples from your submissions of project 1

* Will you extend the quiz time because it is kind of hard to double check the answer."

I believe the quiz time is already enough. You should use the practice quiz as practice. Time to double check your answers is not included.

* Why are points taken off for syntax errors on the weekly quiz? I do not understand the idea behind this, as I think focusing on the material/concepts is more important.  

For the same reason for which you lose points in math exams for computational mistakes, even if the topic of the class is not algebra. If you do not know the syntaz properly, your code will be full of errors, and you coding will not be efficient. Think what would happen if every time you do some computations you did a mistake. The idea is similar

* For class next week are we going over the three different functions for project two?

yes

* when can we get project 1 feedback ? because I am not sure if I have met all project requirements. If not, I can do some changes on project 2.

Just sent to you via email (Sunday evening)

* I am just a little confused as to how the sublot correlates to plt.plot.

subplot creates the space (table) for plotting more than one graph on the same image.

* What is the difference between jupyter lab and notebook? They seem very similar?

They are pretty similar. Jupyter notebook is suggested as the tool to start from.

* How would you do 3d graphs in matplotlib?

`here <https://matplotlib.org/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/tutorial.html>`_ and `here <https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/04.12-three-dimensional-plotting.html>`_ with the help of google

* "How much outside stuff can we use? And are lectures posted rather than just the code?

The lectures are posted on UBLearns as said on the class website (the same question was asked in week 1 - see below). **Code from outside -> None**. You can use external sources for citations but you need to properly reference them. 

* How would we use break/continue in loops within list comprehension? Just add it towards the end appropriately like we do with multiple line codes?

We do not. There are some complex way of getting to a similar result. In that case though, I would not use list comprehension.

* In class you used "from math import sin, cos, etc. Can you just import math as *blank* like we do with plotting?

We saw that in class ``import math as m``

* Is there a more efficient way to find if a number is prime?

Maybe. I am open to ideas

* For the project do we need to create the functions that you suggested in order to create the properly working function or can we go another route?

You need to show that you can create those functions. Then if you wan to tgo a different way you can, but be sure to explain it well

* what are some ways to be creative with coding. i find myself not being able to come up with responses as quickly as my classmates and im wondering if i am behind the pace of the course

reading books about coding is useful. 'Automate the boring stuff with python' is an interesting one. Practice is important to get better. I would not worry too much about being the first to answer questions, what is important is that you can stay up to speed with the class material

* How does the zig zag plot work? Would you use figsize to also resize the comparison plots (the four we did side by side)?

we can talk about this in class.

* When using figsize, what do the two numbers mean? I thought it was the dimensions of the graph but, looking at some graphs, that doesn't appear to be true.

width and height of the figure

Week 3
~~~~~~

* Will we be using indexing to perform certain operations on different parts of the same matrix? 

yes. We will be using indexing more often as we proceed with the course. We will mostly use it with arrays (not introduced yet) and lists

* Is there any good resources to get more help with latex syntax? 

`here <http://tug.ctan.org/info/short-math-guide/short-math-guide.pdf>`_

* How come a list of numbers is sometimes shown vertically and sometimes shown horizontally? If I recall correctly, if I don't print the list, it's shown vertically. Is this because it's treated as a column vector in that case?

Using the print() function will print it in a better form.

* I'm used to writing types like string x = "string" but python doesnt really have that option, when writing functions how can we differentiate which parameter is what when passing in arguments? Ex with your volume(x,y) is there a way to differentiate which one gets squared  while you're using the function or is that what comments are for?

Python allows for more flexibility than say C++ or Java, so you do not have to define the variable type when crating a variable. In the same fashion a function does not need to know the variable type. The same function might be used with different variables. To differentiate which variable is which you might assign them via keyword.

* I feel comfortable with the material and everything you go over has made sense so far but I have not done well on the quizzes because of the time.  I was wondering what the average of the quiz because I want to see if I am behind the class in terms of quiz grades. 

The average for quiz 2 and 3 is 7.3 and 7 respectively.

* Are we allowed to use additional sources (and their code) for things like plotting graphs, or creating tables etc. as long as we cite them as a source in our projects?

You are allowed to use external resources and you must cite them properly. However you cannot submit code that is not yours. For example using a built-in function that I did not show in class, like for example plt.grid() to add a grid to your plot and make it nicer is OK. But submitting code that create the ``single_step()`` function taken from online, is NOT OK even if you properly cite it.

* When plotting in matplotlib, is there any way of changing the colors of the main title or axis titles?

``plt.title('pippo',color='r')``
``plt.xticks(color='b')``

* Are there other ways to graph in Python besides matplotlib? Are there other visual aids that we will learn in the future? (similar to plotting a graph)

yes! we will see some of them later in the course.

* Will each project be graded more strictly as the semester goes on?

No. I am usually more lenient with the first one (since it's the first one) but in general the metric is always the same. One thing that I will keep an eye out for would be repeated mistakes, though.

* im not sure if it has been presented  on the course website but is there a rubric for the projects and how they will be graded.

:doc:`Project Report Guide <report_guide>`

* Could you please go over more about the plot? because that was too fast to catch up. Can you show more example and explanation about creating plot? I have confusion with how to insert x and y and how to create a graph with function. Some of the plotting commands are a little muddled and confusing to me, is there any way to understand them more easily?

yes, I can spend some time on Monday.

* Is there such thing as a project which is too long? For example, will I get points taken away for having a drawn out answer. I ask because I want to include enough information to get a good grade but not too much where it is not beneficial to me.

There is no such thing as a project that is too long :)

* what situation(s) would mutable or non-mutable objects be used?

If you need to build a variable that should not be changed, it should be a non-mutable object (for example a tuple over a list) 

* "what is the different between () and [], like the example in the class, a=[1,2,3] and a=(1,2,3), so in what situation I should use those two?

The one with brackets is a list, the one with parenthesis is a tuple. Tuples are non-mutable. The question above as more info.

* another question is what is tuples mean? I not understand."

A tuple is a non-mutalbe list

 
* In the below part-- When we are plotting using matplotlib and creating legends, does it automatically create legends for plots sequentially? Do we not have to assign plots to specific titles in the legend?"

.. code:: python

	plt.plot([1,2,3],[2,4,8],'gs-') # k is black, g, r ,b, y
	plt.plot([1,2,3],[2,8,6],'k--')
	plt.plot([1,2,3],[2,7,9],'m:')
	plt.plot([1,2,3],[2,5,3],'r.')
	plt.plot([2],[8],'b*')
	plt.legend(['green','black','magenta','red','blue'])``

You can either do the legend at the end, or add it to every plot with the argument ``label`` directly in the plot command. In that case you will need to run ``plt.legend()`` for the legend to be visible.

* How do i import different packages into python?

with an import statement. We have seen that in week 1 and 2

* Why is my participation grade always dropping when I come to class and do the weekly summary?

The participation grade that you get an email about every week, accounts for your class attendance to our zoom classes. If you join a few minutes late, that might cause your score to drop a little. Any final score above 95% will be considered as full attendance.

* Can you go over how to add the spell checker into python?

There are some instructions for this on discord (in the class server). I'll be also happy to help at office hours

* Can we get more outside practice problems or links. Also maybe I need to keep pace but there has to be a way for me to be competitive with the other students who clearly have a python background.

* I am confused about question 7 on quiz 4. If we create two arguments and call a function with a different number of arguments, that is an error. How should I fix this?

One way is to set one of the arguments to a default value. that way calling the function with only one argument won't give an error.

* If you were to use the mylist.pop command, is there a way to use the command and not completely delete a whole section of the list. What I mean is for example, in class, we removed purple from the list. Lets say in the same list there was also blue and green. Could you delete purple and green using mylist.pop?

Yes. In case of nested lists you would need to call the ``pop`` command on the nested list. I can show an example in class. (please remind me if I forget)

* Is python the best tool to use for computations? Can sequences be an ordered list of pairs of numbers?

Python is free, very versatile and user friendly. This makes it a very well spread compiting language. Depending on what computations you are planning it might or might not be the best one. The second question is not completely clear. Do you mean a list whose elements are ordered pairs? That can be done in python.

* When is our next project?

The next project will be introduced in week 4, and will be due at the end of week 5.

Week 2
~~~~~~

* For the gradescope quizzes, will you post a document with the answers? (So that we will be able to see what we were missing or did incorrectly)

I will not post the answers to the quiz, but I'll be happy to discuss the quiz at office hours if something about the grading/answer is not clear. Also you can always paste your code in the jupyter-notebook to run it and check if it produces the desired output.

* Will run time be an issue for future project/functions? Things are easier with loops but they also increase runtime by a significant amount. Maybe you can go over ways to optimize looping or something like that

We will see a few ways to avoid too many loops. I will not grade your code for efficency (or execution speed). All of the projects we will work on should have a reasonable run time (of the order of minutes/seconds)

* I think I may have missed it in class, but how much is the analysis portion of the project going to typically be worth? Also, how in depth do we need to go with the analysis?

The analysis/narrative portion of the project is officially worth 40% of your grade (more details are `here <./_static/rubric337.pdf>`_). However as marked in the rubric a project with no analysis could get a lower grade than the actual average grade. How deep the analysis? There isn't a binary answer to that, but I expect that all of the results that you presented are analyzed, and you do a reasonable amount of work.

* If I execute an infinite while loop, is there anyway to stop my computer from over heating without quickly saving my progress and then exiting out of anaconda navigator and python all together? 

You can select the cell that is runnig, and push the stop button from the menu in the jupyter notebook. (I'll show you on Monday what I mean)

* Will we have time in class to go over every project or just for the first one?

We will have some time for all of the projects, but you are expected to also work outside of class time.

* Does this course get exponentially more difficult, or is it consistent difficulty throughout, or somewhere in between or totally different?

Somewhere in between. We will learn more things as we the semester proceeds, so there will be more tool to be used. The complexity of the project will be different from project to project, depending on th etools necessary. Also I have learned that the project difficulty is extremely subjective to the students.

* Do you mind telling us when we will be doing groupwork because I normally study in the silent part of the library so I have to find a new spot when we do.  Thank you!

The plan is to have group work at every class.

* how do you determine whether a `while` loop or `for...in` loop is more useful? If there is a scenario where both for and while loops are acceptable, how do we choose the more optimal one?

I will talk a little about this in class. In general I use ``for`` loops prevalently when I know exactly how long I have to loop for, whereas ``while`` loops are useful if you have to loop 'as long as' some condition is True. (This is not a complete answer)

* what is the different between string and print? In what situation I need use string/print?

a ``string`` is a variable type containing characters. ``Print`` is a python function that will print to screen. 

* How do we indent in the gradescope quiz when writing code? Tab doesn't work for me.

Just put a few spaces

* In what situation should we use return, break and continue? Can you explain more on the while function like how do we use it for? I'm so confused about break and continue. could you go over them again? where should i place the "return" when I def a function? 

``return`` is used in functions to return the function output. ``break`` is used to stop loops, and ``continue`` is used to skip a single iteration. (Will  talk more in class)

* For the project, will there be specific names for the functions you expect us to use or are we allowed to name them and then just have a comment to define what it is?   For the project are we supposed to have a comment alongside each line of code or only when necessary along with the description cell prior?

You can use the names that you prefer. Your code should have comments where they are necessary. Image that you are giving your repost to somebody who knows a little bit of python, but is not in the class. Your code comments should guide the reader through your code, explaining the steps in your code.

* what is your first step when you receive the problem? I alway do not know how to start when i doing the problem.  

I ususally try to think of the steps that I need to take to solve it, and I try to write them down in pseudo-code.

* Even though I can understand "list" "range" "for loop" and other content how they work, it is hard for me to apply these to solve problems by myself. do you have any suggestion? 

Office hours are a good place to ask these kind of questions. Also Wehn working in groups you can discuss with your groupmates to formulate the solution together.

* Is that possible extending the quiz time? because i have no time to double check the answer. Can you make the quiz shorter or giving more time to us? I had took a look and do practice on the sample quiz but I still felt like I don't have enough time to think of the question.

Yes, I can  extend the time or I will make the quiz slightly shorter.

* Will we ever use some of the more complex logical operators such as XOR or shifting?

Probably not

* How do I make conditions for even or odd integers?

What number divides even numbers evenly? We will talk about this a little bit more in class.

* Are indentations kind of like sectioning off the code? 

yes. It organizes the code

* Is it possible to nest a while loop into a for loop?

yes


* How do you decide the background image?

All of the pictures are from places I have been to. All of the pictures have been taken by either myself or my wife. I change the picture from the zoom menu

* Can we have some help links to follow also. I feel like i need to catch up because theres definently more experinced people in the class

There are some links on the class website and in the weekly schedule tab. I'll be happy to help at office hours as well.

* Will you go over numpy and matplotlib?  When will we need to use them?

Yes. We will use matplotlib in almost all the projects (including project 1). numpy will be introduced in a few weeks

* Will there be a project where we must work in groups?

There will not be group projects, but you are allowed to work together to some parts of the projects, as long as you submit your own material.

* Will all of the projects be written using python?

yes, this is a python course


Week 1
~~~~~~


* Will we be using anything else other than Jupyter Notebook and if so what will it be? 

No, we will just use the notebook as it will allow us to combine code and text

* Will we be sent emails of when the projects are posted? What will the weekly schedule show? We will be able to see deadlines/due dates? 

The projects are introduced in class, and the website will be updated accordingly with deadlines and weekly schedule.

* How many projects will there be throughout the semester?

from 7 to up tp 10 depending on how the semester evolves


* For the if, then print part of coding that we covered, if you want to compute a list of n/d do you need to input n and d every time or is there a shortcut where python can do that? Like say a table of values that python can then take the numbers from?

Good question! python offers a few ways to loop through a set of values. We will see more of this in week 2

* If we watch and participate in all lectures, should the projects be relatively easy?

We will work in class to some parts of te projects, so participating to the lecture will help for sure.


* Do you have any suggested methods for studying for quizzes or succeeding with projects?

For the quizzes, the practice quiz and asking questions should help. 

For the projects I'll answer with more details in class. 

* Are there any websites you might recommend that would give good advice on coding similar to the class, other than the notes from Prof. Cunningham?

Google is usually a good palce to start. The `python documentation page <https://docs.python.org/3/>`_ might also be a good place (maybe a littel overwhelming at first)

* When the course starts to pick up a little, what is the highest level of code we will be doing?  I have only taken CSE 115 so I am not the best coder in the world, is that going to be alright?

The level of coding will grow as the semester proceeds. However, no prior programming experience is assumed for this class. So we will build up all of the necessary tools together.

* I am wondering how you are able to have line numbers show up on Jupyter Notebook, because for me it doesn't, even though I installed the latest version. I also remember you talking about the difference between the green and blue on the left side of the code/markdown, but I do not remember exactly why that was important. 

The line numbers are a jupyter notebook extension (we will talk about it on week 2). Blue cells are not active, green cells are active.

* How in depth does the class go regarding the mathematics aspect? Are we going to be doing any calculus within Python, for example? Will we be designing our own functions (i.e. defined functions) or are we only going to be using what Python and other libraries have already developed?

We will cover some mathematics in the course, but if i need a specific topic, I will cover it not giving it for granted. We will design functions and used several libraries

* Are you allowed to have variables in between the $$'s? ex  $$var$$  where var is 5

Can you be more specifc about this question via email?

* What are some of the limitations to python?

Not super efficient compared to other coding languages

* For the projects, do we find a problem to solve, or are we given a problem?

I will give you the problem

* Is this class considered object oriented programming?

no

* I am new with La Tex, I cannot follow sometimes during classes like after the code be executed then I cannot see the original code. (Then I will lose lol)  2. Is there a way I can see the code that you wrote during classes? 

Just ask me during the lecture and I can show the code again. You can also reach out via email after class, or come to office hours.

* How do you determine which students to give extra credit to? Is it relative to other students' work or based on a personal standard? 

Based on your participation in the class, and based on the quality of your work

* what is the different between using math import and math import * and what is the easier way to use it? I am confused with the import statement. Sometimes I saw you type from (something) import (something), and sometimes you just type import (something). Do these two bring the same result? 

I will answer in class.

* What is the difficulty level of projects?  

You'll see :).

* From past experience, what aspect of this class do you believe is that students struggle with the most? 

The narrative/organization component of the projects

* I saw the sample quiz2 and I was wondering how we are going to submit the codes to the Graderscop? 

Type it in text boxes.

* Will the notes as well as the lecture video be uploaded after each class?

They are. Notes are on the :doc:`Weekly Schedule  <weekly_schedule>` tab, videos are on UBLearns -> Tools -> Panopto Content

* In class, you show some of your code as examples or notes and such. Will your coding files be posted somewhere as .ipynb on ublearns, or the course website, or will the code only be accessible through the recordings?

see above

* What is the topic for the first project report?

:doc:`here <Projects/part_sequence/part_sequence>`

* matplotlib does not import for me through juputyer notebook. is there a step that i missed in importing or configuring juputyer notebook?

What do you mean? I might be able to help you more specifically at office hours.

* How much coding will there be in this course? Is Python the only coding language that we will be learning in a math setting?

A significant amoutn. Python will be the major focus.
